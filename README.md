# My Open-source Project Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of various open-source projects that showcases my individual contributions to the open-source community. The portfolio provides an overview of the projects, the technologies used, and the impact the projects have made. It serves as a platform to showcase the individual's skills and knowledge in software development and demonstrates their commitment to the open-source community. The portfolio provides an opportunity for others to learn from the individual's work and collaborate on new projects.

## Data Science Projects

### 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- Project Title: "Emotion in Motion: Analyzing Sentiments of Movie Reviews"

**Description**: I used natural language processing techniques to build a sentiment analysis model that classified movie reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. The dataset for this project was found on Kaggle, "IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis" (https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).

Project: [TBD](#)

- Project Title: "Spam Busters: Detecting Spam Emails with Machine Learning"

**Description**: I utilized natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to build a spam email detector. The dataset for this project was found on Kaggle, "Spam Email Classification" (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset).

Project: [TBD](#)

- Project Title: "Categorizing News Articles: A Text Classification Approach"

**Description**: I used natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to build a text classification model that categorized news articles into different topics such as politics, sports, technology, etc. The dataset for this project was found on Kaggle, "BBC News Article Classification" (https://www.kaggle.com/yufengdev/bbc-fulltext-and-category).

Project: [TBD](#)

### 2. Computer Vision (CV)

- Project Title: "Object Detection in Images"

**Description**: In this project, I built a machine learning model to detect objects in images. I used the "COCO 2017 Object Detection" dataset (http://cocodataset.org/#home), which contains images of common objects like people, animals, furniture, and more.

Project: [TBD](#)

- Project Title: "Image Classification: Classifying Clothing Items"

**Description**: In this project, I built a machine learning model to classify images of clothing items into different categories, such as tops, pants, dresses, etc. I used the "Fashion-MNIST" dataset (https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist), which contains 70,000 images of fashion items.

Project: [TBD](#)

- Project Title: "Handwritten Digit Recognition"

**Description**: In this project, I built a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits. I used the "MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition" dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), which contains 60,000 images of handwritten digits.

Project: [TBD](#)

### 3. Time Series Analysis (TS)

- Project Title: "Predicting Stock Prices: A Time Series Analysis Approach"

**Description**: In this project, I utilized time series analysis and machine learning algorithms to build a stock price prediction model. The dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle, "Historical Stock Price Dataset" (https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs).

Project: [TBD](#)

- Project Title: "Forecasting Weather Patterns: A Time Series Analysis"

**Description**: In this project, I employed time series analysis and machine learning techniques to build a weather forecasting model. The dataset for this project was obtained from Kaggle, "Hourly Weather Surface - Brazil" (https://www.kaggle.com/stgelab/hourly-weather-surface-brazil-southeast-region).

Project: [TBD](#)

- Project Title: "Traffic Volume Predictions: Time Series Analysis of Historical Data"

**Description**: In this project, I used time series analysis and machine learning algorithms to build a model that can predict traffic volume on highways. The dataset for this project was gathered from Kaggle, "Hourly Traffic Volume for Bangalore City" (https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/hourly-traffic-volume-for-bangalore-city).
